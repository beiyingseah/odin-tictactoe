# Project 9: javascript-tictactoe
 
 For my 9th project for The Odin Project, I build a small Tic Tac Toe game building on factory functions & the modular pattern. My main goal is to have as little global code as possible. In other words, everything is tucked away inside either a module or factory.

#### SOME KEY LEARNINGS I APPLIED FROM TOP
- CSS variables (or custom properties), namely :root Selector
- CSS function, namely: calc() under :root selector
- Using CSS positioning, namely, 'absolute' and 'relative' positionings to manipulate the design of 'X' and 'o' markers
- HTML form components & validation

## TODOs
### Key functionalities
1. Store the gameboard as an array inside a Gameboard object
2. Store your players in an object as well, say, a module that keeps track the scores of your players
3. Create an object to control the flow of the game itself
4. Create a JS function that will render contents of the gameboard array to the webpage 
5. Create a function that allows the player to add marks to a specific spot on the board
- Then link it up with the DOM -> players click on the gamerboard to place their market 
- Logic needs to ensure that players can't change spots that are already taken
### Layout
1. Allow users to put in their names
2. Include a button to start/restart the game 
3. Add display element that congratulates the winning player


## EXTRA CREDITS
- This is the first project where I also most consciously implement the [MVC architectural pattern](https://medium.com/@aaron.rory.newbold/adopting-the-model-view-controller-mvc-architectural-pattern-in-javascript-3dc0519d57aa)
- Refactor code based on code review (:
- Experiment with a 'neumorphic' design 


## FUTURE VERSIONS
- Enable [AI-mode](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-tic-tac-toe-game-unbeatable-by-using-the-minimax-algorithm-9d690bad4b37/) where players can play against the computer

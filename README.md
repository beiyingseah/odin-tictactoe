# Project 9: javascript-tictactoe
 
 For my 8th project for The Odin Project, I build a small Tic Tac Toe game building on factory functions & the modular pattern. My main goal is to have as little global code as possible.

TODOs for key functionalities
1. Store the gameboard as an array inside a Gameboard object
2. Store your players in an object as well, say, a module that keeps track the scores of your players
3. Create an object to control the flow of the game itself
4. Write JS function that will render contents of the gameboard array to the webpage
